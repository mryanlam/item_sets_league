<h3> Summary </h3>

Item Insights is a user friendly application that allows new players to get a 
better idea of how to efficiently build items in the game of League of Legends. 
With the use of api item documentation we have created an application that will 
be able to implement gold efficiency theory into the game. It is as simple as 
going on to a website like probuilds.com and looking up your favorite pro players 
builds and entering it on to our website. Our website will then break down each 
item and show the user the gold efficiency for each item requested by the player. 

The idea is to allow newer players to get a better grasp on how and why higher 
level players buy the items that they do. The most efficient way to understand 
proper itemization better is to understand the gold efficiency behind each item.  
The hope is that through utilization of our application that new players will be 
able to improve their in-game knowledge much quicker and efficiently.
